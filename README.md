StreamPay marketplace is composed of three different components: the headless server, the storefront, and the admin dashboard.

Medusa provides the necessary tools and resources to set up the three components separately. This ensures that developers have full freedom to choose their tech stack, as they can choose any framework for the storefront and admin dashboard.
